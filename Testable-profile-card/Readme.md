# 🌸 Foide's Profile Card

A sleek, testable Profile Card built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — designed to display user information such as profile image, bio, social links, hobbies, dislikes, and a live clock.

This project was created as part of a front-end test to demonstrate layout design, responsive styling, and JavaScript DOM manipulation.

## 🧩 Features

- 🪞 **Glassmorphism Design**: Soft, blurred background with subtle transparency.
- 👤 **Dynamic Profile Info**: Displays a user's name, avatar, bio, hobbies, and dislikes.
- 🕐 **Live Clock**: Automatically updates every second using JavaScript.
- 🔗 **Social Links**: Clickable icons linking to social platforms.
- 📱 **Responsive Layout**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile screens.
- 🧪 **Test-Ready Elements**: Each component includes data-testid attributes for easy testing.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Structure and content
- **CSS3** – Styling, animation, and layout (Glassmorphism)
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Dynamic time update and interactivity
- **Font Awesome** – Social media icons
- **Google Fonts** – Poppins typography

## ⚙️ Setup & Usage

1. **Clone or Download this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/foidevans/Testable-profile-card.git
Open index.html in your browser

You'll see a profile card with your name, avatar, social icons, and live time.

🧠 How It Works
The JavaScript file (script.js) dynamically inserts the current time into the card and updates it every second.

The CSS file applies a glass-like card design with a floating animation.

Each element is annotated with data-testid attributes for easy automation testing.
